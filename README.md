# Saddle Commands
A plugin that implements a set of commonly used commands. They resemble vanilla commands, but are not necessarily a 1:1
recreation. They are all configurable in the plugin config.

To install this plugin, simply add the following to your `saddle.toml` file and run the launcher:
```toml
[[plugin]]
module  = "github.com/saddlemc/commands"
version = "latest"
```
